# Cloud Journey
## AWS Well-Arhictected Framework
The **Well-Architected Framework** is a ste of **best practices** in building secure, resilient, efficient, and cost-effective cloud architectures.

There are 6 pillars:
- **Operational Excellence**: ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting prorcesses and procedures.
- **Security**: ability to protect information, systems and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
- **Reliability**: ability of a system to do the following:
    - Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions.
    - Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand.
    - Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.
- **Performance Efficiency**: ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demends change and technologies evolve.
- **Cost Optimisation**: ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
- **Sustainability**: ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximising the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimising the total resources required.

## Benefits of the AWS Cloud

- Trade upfront expense for variable expense.
- Benefit from massive economies of scale.
- Stop guessing capacity.
- Increase speed and agility.
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.
- Go global in minutes.
