# Establish Visibility and Manage Spending
## Gaining Visibility Into Cloud Spending
### Cost Explorer
Cost Explorer is a Cost Management feature to **visualise** and better understand costs and usage. It can review **historical cost data** spanning the last 12 months and **forecast likely spend** for the next 12 months.

We can use Cost Explorer to identify spending areas that need further inquiry and see trends to understand our costs.

### Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)
AWS CUR tracks AWS usage and provides **estimated charges** for the account. The reports provide access to **granular data**, helping us better analyse and understand AWS costs, as well as the specific product offerings and usage amounts underlying those costs. 

## Avoiding Overspend with AWS
### AWS Budgets
AWS Budgets is a Cost Management feature to **track and manage** AWS costs. When we create a **budget**, we effectively create an **upper bound** we would like our costs to remain within for a configured time period.

When a budget is created, we can define alert thresholds to notify if costs reach a percentage of the defined budget amount. If spending reaches a defined threshold, we can configure AWS Budgets to deliver notifications over email, as well as to an SNS topic.

### Cost Anomaly Detection
AWS Cost Anomaly Detection is an AWS Cost Management feature that uses ML to **continously monitor cost** and usage to **detect unusual spending**. This tool can be used as another mitigating factor against receiving unexpected bills.
