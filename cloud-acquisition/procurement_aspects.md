# Key Aspects of Procurement
## Pricing
Cloud pricing provides **publicly available pricing** to all customers. Unlike legacy IT, customers:
- Use a **pay-as-you-go model** with on-demand, utility-like pricing.
- Have no upfront costs.
- Are not required to make a long-term financial commitment.

## Security
AWS is responsible for the separation of physical and logical access of the cloud. Customers retain ownership and control of their content to meet the **shared security objectives**.

### Customer Responsibility
Customers are responsible for security **in** the cloud. When using AWS services, we maintain complete control over our content and are responsible for managing critical content security requirements, including:
- What content we choose to put on AWS.
- Which services we use.
- In which AWS Region content stays.
- The fromat and structure of that content and whether it is masked, anonymised, or encrypted.
- Who has access to that content and how those access rights are granted, managed, and revoked.

### AWS Responsibility
AWS is responsible for security **of** the cloud. AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure including Regions, Availability Zones, and edge locations.

## Data Sovereignty and Data Residency
Two major topic for many customers are:
- **Data sovereignty**: ownership over data.
- **Data residency**: requirement that all content processed and stored in an IT system remain within a specific country's borders.

In the shared responsibility model, customers:
- Continue to own their data.
- Choose the geographic location(s) to store their data.
- Can download or delete their data whenever they like.
- Can "crypto-delete" their data by deleting the master encryption keys that are required to decrypt their data keys.
- Should consider the sensitivity of their data and decide if and how to encrypt the data while it is in transit and at rest.

## Sustainability
AWS is more sustainable than on-premises infrastructure, because AWS:
- Focuses on energy efficiency.
- Continuously innovates in data centers to reduce energy usage.
- Uses scale to achieve much higher resource usage and energy efficiency than the typical on-premises data center.
- Has global infrastructure that is built on Amazon custom hardware - purpose built and optimised for workloads run by AWS customers.

## Governance and Operationalisation
Cloud governance references to the set of policies, processes, and practices implemented to effectively **manage and control** the use of **cloud resources** within an organisation. It involves establishing guidelines and mechanisms to ensure compliance, security, cost optimisation, and operation efficiency in the cloud environment.

## Terms and Conditions
CSPs operate on a **one-to-many** scale to offer **standardised services**. It is critical that we:
- Engage CSPs early to get the best fit and resolve differences.
- Incorporate and use the CSP's terms to the fullest extent possible to avoid misalignment.
- Avoid traditional IT contract terms as the basis for a cloud contract.
- Recognise the differences among CSPs, cloud-managed service providers, and resellers.

### Agreement Forms
AWS has 2 different agreement forms for customers who directly contract with AWS:
- **Online Customer Agreement**: accepeted during the AWS account registration process. AWS can update these T&Cs at any time. The majority of AWS customers are on this agreement.
- **AWS Enterprise Agreement**: gives certain customers the option to tailor agreements that best suit their needs.
