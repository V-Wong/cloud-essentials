# Introduction to AWS
## Client-Server Model
In a **client-server** model:
- **Client**: makes requests to a computer server.
    - Can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with.
- **Server**: fulfils the client's request.
    - Can be a service such as Amazon EC2.

## Cloud Computing
**Cloud computing** has the following components:
- **On-demand delivery**: resources can be allocated (deallocated) when we (don't) need them.
    - This is not possible with on-premise data centres.
- **IT resources**: many products to support different business needs.
- **Over the internet**: access to the IT resources using a secure webpage console or programatically.
- **Pay-as-you-go pricing**: no contracts are established, we only pay for what we use and when.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing has the following benefits:
- **Variable expense**: removes the need to invest heavily in data centers and servers before we know how we're going to use them.
- **Lower maintenance costs**: removes the cost of maintaining hardware (AWS is responsible for this).
- **Don't need to guess capacity**: removes the need to predict infrastructure capacity before application deployment.
- **Economies of scale**: AWS can offer lower costs as their large customer base can aggregate in the cloud.
- **Increased speed and agility**: faster development and experimentation as resources can be obtained within minutes.
- **Global in minutes**: applications can be deployed to customers around the world quickly, while providing low latency.
