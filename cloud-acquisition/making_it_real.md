# Making it Real
## Migrations
### Roadmap
Customers should consider creating a **one-organisation cloud migration roadmap** to provide **clear and actionable guidance** for each step of their cloud migration journey.

### Organisational Change
Cloud adoption may require teams to create **new processes** and acquire **new skills** to ensure they can forecast and resource based on the anticipated program of work.

The different ways AWS customers navigate their cloud migration includes:
- **Agile Approach**: flexible, iterative development approach that emphasises collaboration, stakeholder feedback, and rapid adaptation to change.
- **Sprints**: time-boxed intervals, during which agile development teams complete a specific set of tasks or features.  
- **AWS Incentives**: AWS provides various ways to help us migrate to cloud.
    - **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)**: identifies common cloud migration activites and best practices to optimise migratios and cloud adoption outcomes.
    - **AWS Professional Services (ProServe)**: works with customers to create an AWS CAF action plan which helps us:
        - Prepare for the transition to cloud-based IT.
        - Uncover gaps in our existing skills and processes.
        - Guide management as we transition to the cloud.
    - **AWS Cloud Adoption Readiness Tool (CART)**: helps customers develop efficient and effective plans for cloud adoption and enterprise cloud migrations.
- **AWS Migration Partners**: AWS Migration Competency Partners help us accelerate our cloud migrations. They can help through every stage of migration, accelerating results by providing personnel, tools, and education in the form of professional services.
