# Procurement Foundations
## Rethinking Procurement
Procurement strategies vary between traditional legacy IT and the cloud. In particular, cloud is **dynamic**. New features and services are continually added, and prices are reduced as economies of scale are passed to customers. **Flexible** acquisition processes help enable us to get the latest innovations at the best prices.

## Educating Internal Stakeholders on Buying Cloud
We must have conversations with all relevant **stakeholders** to ensure a smooth transition to cloud. In particular:
- **Security Professionals**: should consider how they can get the security assurance needed through third-party audits and attestations.
- **Human Resources**: need to think about training or retraining staff to use new systems or develop new skills.
- **Finance**: needo think about the internal spend controls they want to put in place to manage spending.
- **Program Managers**: need to think about the shared responsibility model and how they can deploy new projects that exploit the greater visibility and control they have in the new cloud environment.

### Buying the Cloud
The cloud can be bought in 2 different ways:
- **Direct**: use terms designed for a commercially available service and purchased as a commercial item service offered without labour hours. This is simply done by accpeting the AWS Agreement with standard T&Cs.
- **Indirect**: purchased from a CSP partner/reseller, negotiating a customised agreement with that organisation.

## Separating Infrastructure from Services and Labour
Successful cloud strategies separate **cloud technology** provided by a CSP from **hands-on services and labor**, or other managed services needed to use cloud technology.
