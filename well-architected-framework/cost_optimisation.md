# Cost Optimisation Pillar
## Overview
Cost Optimisation is the ability to achieve business outcomes at the **lowest price point**.

## Design Principles
The design principles for cost optimisation in the cloud include:
- **Implement cloud financial management**: our organisation must dedicate the necessary time and resources for building capability in this new domain of technology and user management.
- **Adopt a consumption model**: pay only for the compute resources we consume, and increase or decrease usage depending on business requirements.
- **Measure overall efficiency**: measure business output of the workoad and the costs associated with delivery. Use this data to understand the gains we make from increasing output, increasing functionality and reducing cost.
- **Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting**: focus on customers and business projects rather than on IT infrastructure.
- **Analyse and attribute expenditure**: cloud makes it easy to accurately identify the cost and usage of workloads, which then allows transparent attribution of IT costs to revenue streams and individual workload owners. This helps measure ROI and give workload owners an opportunity to optimise their resources and reduce costs.

## Practice Areas
### Cost-Effective Resources
Using the appropriate services, resources, and configuration for our workload is key to cost savings.

To make savings through cost-effective resources:
- Select the correct **pricing model** that best fits our needs. For example, EC2 offers on-demand instances that have no long-term commitments and Savings Plans and Reserved Instances that offer a discount for certain commitments.
