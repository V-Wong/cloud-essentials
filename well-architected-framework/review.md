# Well-Architected Review
## Overview
Well-Architected Review provides AWS customers and partners with a **consistent approach** to **reviewing their workloads** against current **AWS best practices**, and gives **advice** on how to architect workloads for the cloud.

It involves a **set of questions** across the five WAF pillars.

## Intent of the Review
The review is **not an audit**. It is a way to work together to **improve architctures using best practices**. It should be done **continually over the product's lifecycle**, especially as significant architectural changes are made.

## Benefits of WAF
Benefits of using the AWS WAF include:
- Build and deploy faster.
- Lower or mitigate risks.
- Make informed decisions.
- Learn best practices.

## Applying WAF
AWS has created resources to make it easier to get started:
- A **framework white paper** that gives an overview of the AWS perspective on architecture in the cloud.
- A series of **pillar-specific white papers** that provide specific, prescriptive tips in each area.
- Free **online training**.

All of this content is updated multiple times a year.
