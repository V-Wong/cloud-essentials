# Introduction to Well-Architected Framework (WAF)
## What is the WAF
The WAF covers **strategies** and best **practices** for **archicting in the cloud**. It provides a way to measure our architecture against AWS best practices and identify how to address any shortcomings.

## Purpose of the WAF
It enables customers to make informed decisions about their architecture in a **cloud-native way** and understand the impact of design decisions that are made.

## How the WAF Works
The WAF provides a consistent approach to evaluating workload architectures through a set of questions designed across five pillars with design principles.
