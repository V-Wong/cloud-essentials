# Pricing and Suport
## AWS Free Tier

    - Example: Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month.
- **12 months free**: free for 12 months following initial sign-up date to AWS.
    - Example: specific amounts of S3 standard storage.
- **Trials**: free for a period after activating a service.
    - Example: Inspector offers 90-day free trial.

## AWS Pricing Concepts
### How AWS Pricing Works
AWS offers **pay-as-you-go pricing** with various concepts:
- **Pay for what you use**: pay for exactly the amount of resources we actually use, with no long-term contracts or complex licensing.
- **Pay less when you reserve**: some services offer reservation options that provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.
- **Pay less with volume-based discounts when you use more**: some services offer tiered pricing, so the per-unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage.

### AWS Pricing Calculator
**Pricing Calculator** lets us explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of different use cases.

We can organise AWS estimates by **groups**. A group can reflect how our company is organised, such as providing estimates by cost center.

## Blling & Cost Management Dashboard
The **Billing & Cost Management dashboard** allows us to:
- Pay our AWS bills.
- Monitor our usage.
- Analyse and control our costs.

## Consolidated Billing
**Consolidated Billing** allows us to **centralise** the billing and payment for multiple AWS accounts.

A benefit of consolidated billing is the ability to **share** bulk discount pricing, Savings Plans, and Reserved Instances across the accounts in our organisation.

## AWS Budgets
**AWS Budgets** allows us to set cost and usage thresholds, monitor spending patterns, and recieve alerts to effectively manage and control AWS expenses.

## AWS Cost Explorer
AWS Cost Explorer provides a **detailed analysis** and **visualisation** of AWS usage and costs, enabling us to gain insights, optimise spending, and make informed decisions about our AWS resources. 

## AWS Support Plans
AWS offers four different **Support Plans** to help troubleshoot issues, lower costs and efficiently use AWS services:

The TAM is the **primary point of contact** at AWS. TAMs are responsible for:
- Educating, empowering and evolving our cloud journey.
