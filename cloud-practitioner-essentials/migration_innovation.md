# Migration and Innovation
## AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)
CAF is a structured approach that helps organisations plan, execute, and govern their **migration to the cloud** while optimising for security, cost efficiency, and operational excellence.

CAF organises guidance into 6 areas of focus, called **Perspectives**. These are:
- **Business**: aligns IT with business objectives and ensures IT investments link to key business results.
- **People**: supports development of an organisation-wide change management strategy for successful cloud adoption.
- **Governance**: focuses on skills and processes to align IT strategy with business strategy.
- **Platform**: includes principles and patterns for implementing new solutions on the cloud, and migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.
- **Security**: ensures that the organisation meets security objectives for visibility, auditability, control, and agility.
- **Operations**: helps enable, run, use, operate and recover IT workloads to the level agreed upon with business stakeholders.

## Migration Strategies
The 6 most common migration strategies are:
- **Rehosting**: moves applications without change.
- **Replatforming**: makes a few cloud optimisations to realise a tangible benfit. Does not change the core architecture of the application.
- **Refactoring/Re-arhictecturing**: reimagines how an application is architected and developed by using cloud-native features.
- **Repurchasing**: moves from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service model.
- **Retaining**: keeps critical applications for the business in the source environment.
- **Retiring**: removes applications that are no long needed.

## AWS Snow Family
The **Snow Family** is a collection of **physical devices** that help to **physically transport** up to exabytes of data into and out of AWS.

## Innovation with AWS
Driving innovation in the cloud requires clearly articulating the following conditions:
- The current state.
- The desired state.
- The problems you are trying to solve.
