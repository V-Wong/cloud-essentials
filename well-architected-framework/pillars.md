# Pillars of Well-Architected 
## Background
### Traditional On-Premise Environments
In **traditional environments**, customers:
- Had to guess infrastructure needs.
- Could not afford to test at scale.
- Had a fear of change.
- Could not justify experiments.
- Face architecture that was frozen in time.

### Cloud Environments
In **cloud environments**, customers:
- Stop guessing capacity needs.
- Test systems at production scales.
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier.
- Allow for evolutionary architectures.
- Build data-driven architecture.

## Pillars
The foundation of architecting technology solutions includes:
- Operational Excellence.
- Security.
- Reliability.
- Performance Efficiency.
- Cost Optimisation.

### Operational Excellence
**Operational Excellence** focuses on the ability to **run and monitor systems** to **deliver business value** and to continually **improve supporting processes and procedures**.

### Security Pillar
**Security** focuses on the ability to **protect information, systems and assets** while delivering business value through **risk assessments** and **mitigation strategies**.

### Reliability
**Reliability** focuses on the ability to **recover from failures**.

### Performance Efficiency
**Performance Efficiency** focuses on the ability to **use computing resources efficiently** to **meet system requirements**, and to maintain that efficiency as **demand changes** and **technologies evolve**.

### Cost Optimisation
**Cost Optimisatino** focuses on the ability to achieve business outcomes at the **lowest price point**.
