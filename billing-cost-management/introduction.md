# Billing and Cost Management Introduction
## Importance of Cost Visibility
Cloud usage can **dynamically change** to suit customer needs. This can result in potential **price increases**. Therefore, cost visibility is crucial to understanding the value a cloud environment will deliver to an organisation.

## AWS Billing and Cost Management
Bill and Cost Management is the set of **cost reporting** and **monitoring tools** provided by AWS. With these tools, we can view our paid and unpaid bills, manage payment methods, and monitor and analyse our costs and usage.

### How Can We Use Billing and Cost Management
The four most commonly used features are:
- **AWS Cost Explorer**: visualise, understand, and manage AWS costs and usage over time.
- **AWS Cost and Usage Reports**: achieve visibility into AWS spend.
- **AWS Budgets**: improve planning and cost control with flexible budgeting and forecasting.
- **AWS Cost Anomaly Detection**: help reduce cost surprises with machine learning.

### AWS Billing Dashboard
The AWS Billing Dashboard is a web-based interface that gives access to the many AWS Billing features described previously.

### AWS Cost Management Console
The Cost Management console is closely integrated with the Billing Dashboard. Both are often used together to manage costs in a holistic manner.

Billing console is used to manage ongoing payments and generate reports, while Cost Management console is used to optimise future costs.
